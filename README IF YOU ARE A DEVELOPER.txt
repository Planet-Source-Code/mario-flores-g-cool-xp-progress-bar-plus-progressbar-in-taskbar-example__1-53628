Version XXXXX


2004-01-08	- EXTRA: Added a Module to show the progress bar in the Taskbar, 
                                       the project is not about the progress bar   that’s why I added this code in a different folder....
                                       the propose of this code is to demonstrate how you can animate the tray , 
                                       putting a icon made in run time( the progress bar in this case)….
                                      any other modifications that are made or going to be made to the ProgressBar are going to be done(Post) in the Final Release Folder..

                                      This other code just uses the Cool XP ProgressBar ….

                                     Cheers!!
